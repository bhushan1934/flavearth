# Delhivery API Integration Issue - Updated Report

## Issue Summary
The Delhivery staging API is returning a consistent error when attempting to create shipments:
```
Package creation API error.Package might be saved.Please contact tech.admin@delhivery.com. 
Error message is 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'end_date'
```

## Investigation Results

### 1. Authentication
- API Key is correctly formatted with `Token` prefix (not Bearer)
- Authentication passes for other endpoints (e.g., pincode check returns 401)
- The shipment creation endpoint returns 200 status but with error content

### 2. Request Format
- Confirmed using form data with `format=json&data=` structure as required
- Headers are correctly set
- Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

### 3. Required Fields Tested
- All mandatory fields included: name, address, pin, phone
- GST fields added: seller_gst_tin, hsn_code
- Pickup location matches registered warehouse name
- Special characters properly escaped
- Date formats tested: Y-m-d, Y/m/d, d-m-Y, d/m/Y, Y-m-d H:i:s, Ymd

### 4. API Response
```json
{
    "cash_pickups_count": 0,
    "package_count": 0,
    "upload_wbn": null,
    "replacement_count": 0,
    "rmk": "Package creation API error.Package might be saved.Please contact tech.admin@delhivery.com. Error message is 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'end_date' . Quote this error message while reporting.",
    "pickups_count": 0,
    "packages": [],
    "cash_pickups": 0,
    "cod_count": 0,
    "success": false,
    "prepaid_count": 0,
    "error": true,
    "cod_amount": 0
}
```

## Temporary Solution
A mock service has been implemented to allow testing of the shipment workflow:

1. Set `DELHIVERY_USE_MOCK=true` in `.env` to enable mock mode
2. Mock service simulates successful shipment creation
3. UI displays warning when mock mode is active

## Next Steps
1. Contact Delhivery support at tech.admin@delhivery.com with the error message
2. Verify if the API credentials and warehouse name are correctly configured in their system
3. Check if there are any account-specific requirements or configurations needed

## Code Changes Made
1. Fixed authentication header format
2. Added required GST fields
3. Implemented proper request format (form data)
4. Added special character escaping
5. Created mock service for testing
6. Added configuration toggle for mock/real service

## Testing Commands
```bash
# Test shipment creation
php test_create_shipment.php

# Test with minimal payload
php test_minimal_delhivery.php

# Test different date formats
php test_delhivery_dates.php

# Check shipment status
php shipment_status.php
```

## Production API Test Results (NEW)

### Production API Status
- ✅ **No Python errors** - Production API is more stable
- ❌ **Warehouse not found** - "ClientWarehouse matching query does not exist"
- ✅ **Authentication works** - Pincode check returns valid data

### Key Findings
1. **Staging API**: Has server-side Python error (`'NoneType' object has no attribute 'end_date'`)
2. **Production API**: Works but no registered warehouses found
3. **Authentication**: API key is valid for both environments

### Required Actions
1. **Register a warehouse** with Delhivery for this API key
2. **Get the exact warehouse name** from Delhivery support
3. **Verify API key permissions** for production environment

## Production Readiness
Once the issues are resolved:
1. Register warehouse with Delhivery
2. Update `DELHIVERY_PICKUP_LOCATION` with exact warehouse name
3. Set `DELHIVERY_ENV=production` for live shipments
4. Set `DELHIVERY_USE_MOCK=false` in `.env`
5. Test with real API
6. Keep mock service for development/testing purposes
